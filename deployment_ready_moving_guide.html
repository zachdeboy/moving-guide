                    subtitle: "Set yourself up for success from the start",
                    explanation: "Most moving stress comes from poor planning, not the actual work. Think of this phase as creating your roadmap. By establishing clear systems now, you'll avoid the panic that forces people into expensive last-minute decisions. This week is about understanding the scope of your move and creating the mental framework that will guide all your future decisions.",
                    concepts: "Key concepts: The moving triangle (time, money, stress - you can optimize two), the decluttering dividend (every item you don't move saves money and effort), and the momentum principle (early wins create psychological energy for harder decisions later).",
                    tasks: [
                        "Research moving companies and get 3 quotes (even if you're DIY moving - this teaches you real costs)",

                        "Walk through your home with fresh eyes and estimate: What percentage needs to go to new house vs. donate/sell?",
                        "Buy basic packing supplies: boxes, tape, bubble wrap, markers, labels (buying early saves money)",

                    subtitle: "Transform chaos into three clear categories",
                    explanation: "This is where the real work begins, but it's also where you'll see the biggest emotional payoff. You're not just packing - you're actively choosing what deserves space in your new life. The three-pile system works because it forces a decision on every single item, preventing the 'I'll decide later' trap that creates last-minute chaos. Starting with non-essentials builds your decision-making muscles before you tackle emotionally harder items.",
                    concepts: "The psychology of possession: We often keep things from guilt, fear, or outdated identity. Moving gives you permission to let go. The 'someday' items are usually the easiest first cuts - if you haven't used it in a year, your new house probably doesn't need it either.",
                    tasks: [
                        "Start with storage areas: attic, basement, garage, closets (these have the lowest emotional attachment)",

                    subtitle: "Pack smartly, not just efficiently",
                    explanation: "Now you're transitioning from decision-making to execution, but this isn't just stuffing things in boxes. Strategic packing means thinking about your unpacking experience. You're essentially sending care packages to your future self on moving day. Good labeling and room-by-room systems mean the difference between settling into your new home quickly versus living in chaos for weeks.",
                    concepts: "The unpacking principle: Pack like you're helping a stranger understand your belongings. The room-assignment strategy: Items should be packed according to where they'll live in the NEW house, not where they came from. The essential box theory: Each room should have one clearly marked box that gets opened first.",
                    tasks: [
                        "Pack one room completely to test your system and timing (this teaches you realistic expectations)",

                        "Pack books, decorative items, and seasonal clothes (heavy items in small boxes)",

                    subtitle: "Systematic completion of living spaces",
                    explanation: "You're now in the execution phase where your early planning pays off. By this point, you should feel confident in your systems because you've been practicing for weeks. The goal is to complete entire rooms so you can start mentally transitioning to your new space. Each completed room is a small victory that builds momentum for the final push.",
                    concepts: "The completion satisfaction: Finishing entire rooms provides psychological closure and reduces the feeling of living in chaos. The priority hierarchy: Pack in reverse order of need - you'll need your bedroom functional until the last night, but the dining room can be packed early.",
                    tasks: [
                        "Complete packing: guest rooms, dining room, home office (rooms you can live without)",

                    subtitle: "The crucial last-minute details",
                    explanation: "This final phase is about maintaining your sanity while handling the details that can only be done at the last minute. If you've followed the earlier phases, this week should feel manageable rather than frantic. You're not scrambling to pack everything - you're thoughtfully handling the items you need right up until moving day.",
                    concepts: "The essential-only mindset: You should be living with just the basics this week, like you're camping in your own home. The transition ritual: Taking time to say goodbye to your space helps with the emotional aspect of moving.",

                    explanation: "Moving day itself should feel like the natural conclusion of weeks of preparation, not a frantic scramble. Your job today is project management - supervising the plan you've spent weeks creating. The first week in your new home is about implementing the unpacking strategy you built into your packing system.",
                    concepts: "The supervisor mindset: You're not doing all the heavy lifting yourself - you're ensuring your plan gets executed correctly. The 80/20 rule of unpacking: Getting 80% functional quickly is better than perfectionism that leaves you living in boxes for months.",
